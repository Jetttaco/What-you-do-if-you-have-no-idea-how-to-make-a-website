<p><p1>I woke up in a room consisting of windows on three sides and one concrete wall. Where am I? Who am I? Those were my first thoughts. I was startled when a female voice called out "hello and thank you again test subject! the portal will open in sixty seconds." "portal?" I wondered aloud. Aren't portals only real in sci-fi books and movies? Suddenly a orange oval shaped thing that I could see through popped up in front of my eyes! I tentatively took a step toward it. I finally racked up enough courage to walk through the thing that i'm guessing is a portal. When I came out the other side I noticed that I was outside of the room I was in before. I also noticed that the other portal was blue. I walked around the room and before me there laid a door. when I got near, it slid open.</p1></p>

<p><p2>After the door slid open, I saw another door that seemed to be connected to a button. Then I noticed the cube. it was small and grey, with rounded corners. Was I supposed to pick that thing up? I chuckled at the thought of it. "There didn't appear to be anything else to do with it, so why not give it a shot?" I thought to myself. I walked over to it and surprisingly easily picked it up! "sooo, what am I going to do with you?" I asked the cube."All that was in here was you and the button. The button!" I loudly exclaimed. I ran over to the button and dropped the cube on it. The door promptly slid open and behind it was what looked to be an elevator. I stepped inside and the elevator door shut behind me, and we started moving downward.</p2></p>
